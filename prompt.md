### Feature Request
A simple, minimalist blog frontpage that will display a list of posts. The blog will be my personal diary, where I comment about philosophy, politics, gaming, software development,
and random thoughts.

**Details**
- Each post card sould have an image, title, short description (up to 100 characters), date, and author name
- The cards must be displayed as grid
- It must have pagination
- The design must be modern and simple
- The app must have a dark/light theme switch

**Code Patterns**
- It should be clean and modular
- Avoid creating everything in a single component
- Make use of the Next principles, knowing when to use SSR or client rendering
- Avoid writing exessive coments. When commenting, DO NOT use emojis. The comments should focus on "why" than "how".
